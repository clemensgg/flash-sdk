# Cosmos SDK v0.46.7 Release Notes

This release introduces bug fixes and improvements. Notably the upgrade to Tendermint [v0.34.24](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.34.24).

Please read the release notes of [v0.46.5](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.5) if you are upgrading from `<=0.46.4`.

A critical vulnerability has been fixed in the group module. For safety, `v0.46.5` and `v0.46.6` are retracted.
When using the group module, please upgrade immediately to `v0.46.7`.

**NOTE**: The changes mentioned in `v0.46.3` are no longer required. The following replace directive can be removed from the chains.

```go
# Can be deleted from go.mod
replace github.com/confio/ics23/go => github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/ics23/go v0.8.0
```

Instead, `github.com/confio/ics23/go` must be bumped to **`v0.9.0`**.

Please see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.46.x/CHANGELOG.md) for an exhaustive list of changes.
